      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      I went to Dixon Elementary School which is pretty close to my neihborhood. 
      I had a pretty normal childhood experience for the most part. My favorite story has to be in second grade when I fell on a rock and my teeth were skewed to one side.
      I like this story because it gave me a distinct voice.
      <h2>High School</h2>
      I take 7 classes, I plan on taking Instructional in my Junior Year.
      I have Honors Spanish 1st period, Honors Algebra 2nd period, World Studies 3rd period, Gym 4th period, English 5th period, Biology 6th period, Lunch 7th, and Computer Science 8th.
      I am in Mangaka Club and Video Game Club.
      Computer science is my favorite because I want to major in computer science.
      <h2>Future Plans</h2>
      I plan on going to someplace in Illinois so I can be close to my family, probably UIC.
      I would like to be a video game designer or go into animation.
      I desire to live in Florida.
